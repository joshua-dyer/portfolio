					documents for our clinical research study site.

                <p class="card-description">A local diagnostic sonography company was handing out paper pamphlets as marketing material.  The pamphlets 
					did not do justice to the level of technology that they were providing and we felt it was undermining their technological expertise.  
					We created a simple marketing page that they could share with their clients and potential customers giving details about their 
					company and what they provided.

					convenient solution that is hosted online as a webapp that can load all images from a portable usb stick to be read by the 
					physician on any available device.  We tested the system on iPad tablets, Macbooks, and Windows PCs to ensure device flexibility for the clinic.
